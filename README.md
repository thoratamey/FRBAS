# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System
This is Final Mini Project of SEM 5 as Student at Vidayalankar Insitute Of Technology, University of Mumbai.

## About Project :
This is project is based on attendance system in which attendance is marked by Face Recognition.

Firstly we will create database and then access database and try to match face detected in database and face detected in camera.

If face is matched, then output will display the name of the file without extension(i.e. .png, etc)

Or if face is not matched, the output will display as "Unknown".

In the end, User will have to give email id in which the attendance file will be sent.
